# DeMystify

DeMystify is an unofficial open-source project graph-based analysis of the classic Myst game. In other words, it represents Myst as a graph.

## The Myst Graph

The Myst Graph represents the relationships between the game's cards. It features 1,364 nodes and 3,189 directed or bidirectional edges, shedding light on the game's complex structure.

## Analysis and Insights

Our analysis explores various aspects of the graph, including path analysis, cluster formation, and node properties. We will continue to update and refine our findings through regular blog posts.
