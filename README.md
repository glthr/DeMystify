# DeMystify

![](./DeMystify.png "DeMystify")

DeMystify is an unofficial open-source project graph-based analysis of the classic Myst game. In other words, it represents Myst as a graph.

**Please note that the graph generator, written in Go, has not been released yet; it will be released in this repository on Sunday, May 11, 2025. Contributions will be welcomed!**

## The Myst Graph

The Myst Graph represents the relationships between the game's cards. It features 1,364 nodes and 3,189 directed or bidirectional edges, shedding light on the game's complex structure.

## Analysis and Insights

Our analysis explores various aspects of the graph, including path analysis, cluster formation, and node properties. We will continue to update and refine our findings through regular blog posts.
